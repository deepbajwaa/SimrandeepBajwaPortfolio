For example, certain squads within a team may be concerned with front-end development, meanwhile others are focusing on back-end development.  Nevertheless, the distinct squads must work together closely and simultaneously in efforts which require multiple squads.

I learned about writing clean code through the comments and feedback my mentors gave me on my code. My team started me off with bugs, and then gradually moved me on to stories and features. At first I required help from my mentors, however, over time I started to become more independent. I was presented with opportunities to demonstrate my work to fellow co-workers allowing me to exercise my public speaking skills.

Typescript was a language that I never heard of at the time, so I had to learn a whole new language to be able to start developing using Angular. I began by watching a lot of YouTube videos, and following tutorials on the Angular website. After about a week of learning, I was ready to move on to working on bugs."),o.a.createElement(x,null,"I started off working on small bugs that only required small changes. These bugs usually involved small issues such as a sentence in a financial chart being cut off. An issue like this required minor changes in a single file, such as a slight modification to an existing object or changing a Boolean expression. I gradually moved onto larger bugs that started requiring me to make changes in multiple files and altering the flow functions by changing Boolean expressions and introducing new parameters. From here I started working on component conversions, where I would get an existing component written in AngularJS and convert it to Angular. This required changes such as updating the AngularJS directives (i.e. ng-if to ngIf) in the HTML and modifying the functionality of the component in the Typescript."),o.a.createElement(x,null,"One of my favourite parts about my job was creating meaningful work that I knew would impact hundreds or even thousands of users. For example, sometimes distributors from different countries would approach our team and ask us to create new features that will allow their financial statements to meet their country\u2019s guidelines that may not have been possible before. Being able to work on features of this nature with my fellow co-ops was really exciting and motivating because I knew I would be making a big impact that will continue to make an impact even when I leave CaseWare."),o.a.createElement(O,{level:2},"How did this job relate to my academic studies?"),o.a.createElement(x,null,"This work-term was quite different from what I\u2019ve done at university so far since this work-term focused more on front-end development rather than the backend aspect we focus on at school (i.e. Algorithms).

Higher level languages such as JavaScript tend to mask what goes on in the background unlike C. For example, If I want to push something into an array I can do nameOfArray.push(item); in JavaScript; Whereas in C I would be forced to create my own function to perform this task. In Data Structures we learned what goes on behind the scenes, which is very valuable when higher languages mask all the little details. Although, Java and JavaScript are quite similar but very different at the same time; Object Oriented Programming taught me a lot about the fundamentals of Objects and Polymorphism that I used on a daily basis."),o.a.createElement(x,null,"Software Systems Development and Integration was a course that I found to be particularly helpful. This course put a very strong emphasis on coding according to a certain specification and to make sure to pay attention to the small details. This is very applicable to the workforce because there are times where clients will ask you to build certain features, or even when working on small bugs you have to really think through the changes you are going to make when working on such a large codebase. Another really big takeaway from this course was that it was the first time we did web development at school, and it provided me with basic knowledge of web development.

During my first week I was introduced to Angular (a web framework). Angular is a web framework that focuses on creating efficient and sophisticated single page applications. Angular breaks a page down into components to create webpages. Each component has a selector, Typescript, HTML, and CSS that is associated with it. From here you can use the HTML to define its structure, create functionality using the Typescript, and finally use CSS in order to style the component. Now you can use the selector to reuse the component wherever it is needed instead of having to rewrite the same code, leading to an efficient application. To make your life easier as a developer, Angular has a lot of built-in directives to help you build functionality into your HTML easily. For example, ngIf=\u201cboolean expression\u201d lets you remove a part of a component\u2019s structure based on the boolean expression."),o.a.createElement(S.a,{style:{postition:"relative",left:"60vh"},className:"image-styling",width:500,src:a(196)}),o.a.createElement(O,{level:4},"Software development in a professional environment"),o.a.createElement(x,null,"To manage the software development process my team used JIRA. JIRA is very popular among software development teams, and it is a highly customizable project management system. During the work-term, we had a board specific to our team on JIRA with tickets. There were many different types of tickets including bugs and stories. The way that software development worked on our team was that you first picked up a ticket on JIRA, and then created a branch from the main code to work on that ticket. From there once you were done with your work, you would commit and push your changes using GIT, and then create a pull request for your code to be reviewed. Once your code is given approval, then you would have to get a team member from Quality Assurance (QA) to make sure that the program is behaving correctly and that your fix works as expected. Once QA gives a thumbs up you can go ahead and merge your code into the main code.

My team used the Agile methodology to develop software, more specifically we used the Scrum framework. In the Scrum framework we have two main roles: the Product Owner and the Scrum Master. The Scrum Master has many different responsibilities such as encouraging the team, protecting the team, and facilitating scrum ceremonies. The product owner represents the client, and comes up with user stories from the requests from our clients that the team will work on. The Scrum framework also consists of important ceremonies such as standups, retrospectives, and backlog refinements. Standups consist of the team members discussing what they have been working on the previous workday and what they\u2019re going to be working on today. During backlog refinements we look at tickets and point them using pointing poker. Finally, during retrospectives we get together and talk about what we did well in the past sprint, and what we could do better during the next sprint. Using the scrum framework we work in small iterations called sprints that can be anywhere from 2 weeks all the way to 8 weeks, and at the end of a sprint our goal is to deliver working software (i.e. a new feature) to the client."),o.a.createElement(S.a,{style:{postition:"relative",left:"60vh"},className:"image-styling",width:500,src:a(197)}),o.a.createElement(O,{level:2},"Conclusion"),o.a.createElement(x,null,"Ultimately, this work term surpassed my expectations.
