My name is Simrandeep Bajwa, and I am a 3rd year student at the University of Guelph majoring in Computer Science along with a minor in Business.Through the following reflection, I will showcase my involvement and the experience I have obtained through my first Co-op work term. Through hard work and numerous job applications, I was fortunate enough to land a job as a Software Developer at CaseWare for 8 months. In retrospect, I was very nervous going downtown Toronto for this job interview. Nevertheless, I\u2019m appreciative that Caseware took me under their wing and opened up new opportunities, further expanding my interest in software engineering."),o.a.createElement(x,{level:2},"What does CaseWare do?"),o.a.createElement(A,null,"Caseware is an international corporation that focuses on developing software solutions for auditing, financial reporting, and data analytics. They have a range of solutions that serve at different levels such as accounting firms, corporations, and government bodies. Caseware consists of several teams as every team focuses on distinct software and different parts of the codebase. For example, certain squads within a team may be concerned with front-end development, meanwhile others are focusing on back-end development.  Nevertheless, the distinct squads must work together closely and simultaneously in efforts which require multiple squads. Caseware continuously works on pushing out new innovative technology to change the future of accounting and auditing. Caseware even has some products that use artificial intelligence in order to perform an analysis on a given data set and transactions to detect any anomalies."),o.a.createElement(x,{level:2},"Goals"),o.a.createElement(A,null,"In order to make this experience educational and advantageous for myself, I established the following goals:",o.a.createElement("br",null),"1.

I was able to learn the Agile methodology through courses on Linkedin learning and by engaging in daily Agile ceremonies. My team used Angular to create the front-end of our application, which allowed me to learn about web development. I learned about writing clean code through the comments and feedback my mentors gave me on my code. My team started me off with bugs, and then gradually moved me on to stories and features. At first I required help from my mentors, however, over time I started to become more independent. I was presented with opportunities to demonstrate my work to fellow co-workers allowing me to exercise my public speaking skills. After reaching all of these goals, I can truly say that I have grown immensely as a person and a developer."))}}]),t}(n.Component),W=(t(176),t(178)),B=t(192),N=t(193),P=t(12),T=W.a.Header,M=W.a.Sider,q=W.a.Content,G=function(e){Object(c.a)(t,e);var a=Object(m.a)(t);function t(){var e;Object(i.a)(this,t);for(var n=arguments.length,o=new Array(n),r=0;r<n;r++)o[r]=arguments[r];return(e=a.call.apply(a,[this].concat(o))).state={collapsed:!1},e.toggle=function(){e.setState({collapsed:!e.state.collapsed})},e}return Object(s.a)(t,[{key:"render",value:function(){return o.a.createElement(d.a,null,o.a.createElement("div",{className:"App"},o.a.createElement(W.a,{style:{minHeight:"100vh"}},o.a.createElement(M,{trigger:null,collapsible:!0,collapsed:this.state.collapsed},o.a.createElement("div",{className:"logo"}),o.a.createElement(C,null)),o.a.createElement(W.a,{className:"site-layout"},o.a.createElement(T,{className:"site-layout-background"},o.a.createElement(this.state.collapsed?B.a:N.a,{className:"trigger",onClick:this.toggle}),o.a.createElement("img",{src:"./3rd.jpg",alt:"selfie"}),o.a.createElement("span",null,o.a.createElement("img",{src:"IMG_0607.JPG",alt:"test"}))),o.a.createElement(q,{className:"site-layout-background",style:{margin:"24px 16px",padding:24}},o.a.createElement(P.a,{path:"/SimrandeepBajwaPortfolio",exact:!0}),o.a.createElement(P.a,{path:"/SimrandeepBajwaPortfolio/Caseware",component:S}))))))}}]),t}(n.Component);Boolean("localhost"===window.location.hostname||"[::1]"===window.location.hostname||window.location.hostname.match(/^127(?:\.(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)){3}$/));l.a.render(o.a.createElement(o.a.StrictMode,null,o.a.createElement(G,null)),document.getElementById("root")),"serviceWorker"in navigator&&navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then((function(e){e.unregister()})).catch((function(e){console.error(e.message)}))}},[[108,1,2]]]);
